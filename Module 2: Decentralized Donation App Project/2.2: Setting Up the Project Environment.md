## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll set up the development environment for our Decentralized Donation App. This involves creating the project folder, initializing a Hardhat project, and installing the necessary dependencies.

## Step 1: Creating the Project Folder

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. **Create a new folder** for the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir decentralized-donation-app
   cd decentralized-donation-app
   ```

This will create a new folder named `decentralized-donation-app` and change your working directory to it.

## Step 2: Initializing a Hardhat Project

1. **Initialize a new Hardhat project** by running:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

2. **Choose the options**:
   - When prompted, select **"Create a basic sample project"**.
   - Confirm any additional prompts, including the installation of dependencies. This setup will create the necessary Hardhat files and folders, including a sample contract, `Greeter.sol`, and a sample script.

3. **Project Structure**:
   After initialization, your project folder should look like this:
   - `contracts`: Directory for your Solidity contracts.
   - `scripts`: Folder for your deployment scripts.
   - `test`: Folder for testing your contracts.
   - `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for Hardhat.

## Step 3: Installing Necessary Dependencies

We need to install additional dependencies that will help us develop and test our project:

1. **Install Hardhat Toolbox**:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
   ```

   Hardhat Toolbox provides a collection of plugins and utilities, including Ethers.js, for interacting with Ethereum.

2. **Install `dotenv`** (for managing environment variables securely):

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

   We’ll use `dotenv` to manage sensitive information, like private keys and API keys, in a `.env` file.

---

## Step 4: Configuring `hardhat.config.js`

1. **Open `hardhat.config.js`** in your code editor.
2. **Update the file** to include the necessary configurations for local development and testnet deployment:

   ```javascript
   require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
   require("dotenv").config();

   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.8.0",
     networks: {
       localhost: {
         url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545", // Local Hardhat network
       },
       sepolia: {
         url: `https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/${process.env.ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
         accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`],
       },
     },
   };
   ```

### Explanation:
- **`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`**: Provides plugins for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping your private keys secure.
- **Networks**:
  - **localhost**: Used for local development and testing.
  - **sepolia**: Configuration for deploying to the Sepolia testnet. We use Alchemy (or another node provider) for connecting to Sepolia, and we’ll manage sensitive information like API keys and private keys using `dotenv`.

3. **Create a `.env` File** in the project root directory:
   - **Add the following content**:

     ```plaintext
     ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your-alchemy-api-key
     PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
     ```

   > **Note**: Replace `your-alchemy-api-key` with your Alchemy API key and `your-wallet-private-key` with your wallet’s private key. Make sure your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to keep it secure.

## Wrapping Up

You’ve successfully set up the project environment! Your Hardhat project is ready for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. In the next lesson, we’ll dive into writing the `DonationContract` smart contract.
