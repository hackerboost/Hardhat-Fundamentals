## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll write and run automated tests for our `DonationContract` using **Hardhat** and **Mocha**. Testing is a crucial step to ensure the contract behaves as expected and handles edge cases gracefully. We’ll cover scenarios like making successful donations, testing edge cases, and ensuring only the owner can withdraw funds.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Testing Environment

1. **Navigate to the `test` folder** in your project directory.
2. **Create a new test file** named `DonationContractTest.js`.

## Step 2: Writing Automated Tests

Open `DonationContractTest.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("DonationContract", function () {
    let DonationContract, donationContract, owner, donor1, donor2;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        // Deploy the contract before each test
        [owner, donor1, donor2] = await ethers.getSigners();
        DonationContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("DonationContract");
        donationContract = await DonationContract.deploy();
        await donationContract.deployed();
    });

    it("should accept donations and update totalDonations", async function () {
        // Donor1 sends 1 ETH
        await donationContract.connect(donor1).donate({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });
        expect(await donationContract.totalDonations()).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));
        expect(await donationContract.donations(donor1.address)).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("1"));

        // Donor2 sends 2 ETH
        await donationContract.connect(donor2).donate({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("2") });
        expect(await donationContract.totalDonations()).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("3"));
        expect(await donationContract.donations(donor2.address)).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2"));
    });

    it("should reject donations of zero ETH", async function () {
        await expect(donationContract.connect(donor1).donate({ value: 0 })).to.be.revertedWith("Donation must be greater than zero");
    });

    it("should only allow the owner to withdraw funds", async function () {
        // Donor1 sends 1 ETH
        await donationContract.connect(donor1).donate({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });

        // Non-owner tries to withdraw and should fail
        await expect(donationContract.connect(donor1).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith("Only the owner can withdraw funds");

        // Owner withdraws funds successfully
        const initialOwnerBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(owner.address);
        const tx = await donationContract.connect(owner).withdraw();
        const receipt = await tx.wait();
        const gasUsed = receipt.gasUsed.mul(receipt.effectiveGasPrice);
        const finalOwnerBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(owner.address);

        expect(finalOwnerBalance).to.equal(initialOwnerBalance.add(ethers.utils.parseEther("1")).sub(gasUsed));
    });

    it("should revert if there are no funds to withdraw", async function () {
        await expect(donationContract.connect(owner).withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith("No funds to withdraw");
    });
});
```

### Explanation of the Tests

1. **Setup with `beforeEach`**:
   - Deploys a fresh instance of `DonationContract` before each test to ensure isolation.
   - Retrieves signers: `owner`, `donor1`, and `donor2` for testing different roles.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - **Accepting Donations**: Verifies that donations are recorded correctly and the total donation amount is updated.
   - **Rejecting Zero Donations**: Ensures that sending 0 ETH as a donation reverts with an appropriate error message.
   - **Owner-Only Withdrawal**: Checks that only the contract owner can withdraw funds. It also verifies that funds are transferred correctly, and gas costs are accounted for.
   - **Reverting on No Funds**: Ensures that the contract reverts if there is an attempt to withdraw when there are no funds available.

## Step 3: Running the Tests

1. **Run the tests using Hardhat**:
   - Open your terminal and execute:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat test
     ```

2. **Check the Output**:
   - If all tests pass, you’ll see output indicating the number of tests run and their success. If any test fails, the output will show details to help you debug.

## Step 4: Debugging Issues

- **Common Errors**: 
  - **Incorrect Address Handling**: Double-check the addresses used in the tests.
  - **Gas Costs**: Ensure gas calculations are accurate when comparing balances.
- **Use `console.log`**: Add `console.log` statements in your tests to debug values and understand where things might be going wrong.

## Wrapping Up

You’ve successfully written and run automated tests for your `DonationContract`. Testing is crucial to ensure your contract handles all scenarios correctly and securely. In the next lesson, we’ll move on to building the front-end interface to interact with our smart contract.
