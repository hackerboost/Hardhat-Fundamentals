## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll design and implement the `DonationContract` in Solidity. We’ll cover the key functionalities needed for a decentralized donation app, including receiving donations, tracking donors, and allowing the contract owner to withdraw funds.

## Writing the `DonationContract` in Solidity

1. **Open the `contracts` folder** in your project and create a new file named `DonationContract.sol`.
2. **Write the following Solidity code** in `DonationContract.sol`:

   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

   contract DonationContract {
       // State variables
       address public owner;
       uint256 public totalDonations;
       mapping(address => uint256) public donations;

       // Events
       event DonationReceived(address indexed donor, uint256 amount);
       event FundsWithdrawn(uint256 amount);

       // Constructor: Sets the contract owner to the deployer
       constructor() {
           owner = msg.sender;
       }

       // Function to receive donations
       function donate() public payable {
           require(msg.value > 0, "Donation must be greater than zero");

           donations[msg.sender] += msg.value;
           totalDonations += msg.value;

           emit DonationReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
       }

       // Function to withdraw all funds (only owner can call this)
       function withdraw() public {
           require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
           uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
           require(balance > 0, "No funds to withdraw");

           (bool success, ) = owner.call{value: balance}("");
           require(success, "Transfer failed");

           emit FundsWithdrawn(balance);
       }
   }
   ```

## Understanding the Basic Functionality

### 1. Receiving Donations
- **Function**: `donate()`
- **Purpose**: Allows users to send ETH to the contract. The donation amount is added to the `donations` mapping, which tracks how much each address has donated. The total amount of donations is also updated.
- **`msg.value`**: This is the amount of ETH sent by the user in the transaction.
- **Event**: `DonationReceived` is emitted to log the details of the donation.

### 2. Tracking Donors
- **Mapping**: `mapping(address => uint256) public donations;`
- **Purpose**: Maps each donor's address to the amount they’ve donated. This allows us to track individual contributions and make the donation history transparent.

### 3. Withdrawing Funds
- **Function**: `withdraw()`
- **Purpose**: Allows only the contract owner to withdraw the total funds collected. The balance is sent to the owner's address using `owner.call{value: balance}("")`.
- **require**: Used to check conditions (e.g., only the owner can withdraw, and there must be funds available).
- **Event**: `FundsWithdrawn` is emitted when the funds are successfully withdrawn.

## Explanation of Solidity Concepts Used

### 1. **Events**
- **Purpose**: Events are used to log activity on the blockchain. They’re helpful for tracking actions like donations and withdrawals.
- **Example**: `event DonationReceived(address indexed donor, uint256 amount);`
  - `indexed`: Allows filtering of event logs based on specific parameters.

### 2. **Mappings**
- **Purpose**: Mappings are data structures used to store key-value pairs, similar to a hash table. In this contract, we use a mapping to associate each donor's address with their total donations.
- **Example**: `mapping(address => uint256) public donations;`

### 3. **Address Handling and `msg.sender`**
- **`msg.sender`**: Refers to the address of the person who called the function. It’s used to identify the contract owner and the donor in this contract.
- **Address and Balance**: `address(this).balance` gives the total amount of ETH stored in the contract.

### 4. **Owner-Only Functions**
- **Purpose**: Restrict certain actions to the contract owner. We use `require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");` to enforce this.
