## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll compile our `DonationContract` using Hardhat, run a local Hardhat node for testing, and deploy the contract to our local blockchain. We’ll also cover how to interpret the deployment output.

## Step 1: Compiling the Smart Contract

1. **Open your terminal** in the project root directory.
2. **Run the compile command**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Check for errors or warnings**:
   - If the compilation is successful, you’ll see a message indicating that the contract has been compiled, and new files will be created in the `artifacts` and `cache` folders.
   - If there are errors, double-check your Solidity code in `DonationContract.sol`.

## Step 2: Running a Local Hardhat Node

1. **Start a local Hardhat node**:
   - Open a new terminal in the project root and run:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat node
     ```

   - This command launches a local Ethereum network on your machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`. You’ll see output displaying 20 pre-funded accounts with private keys, which you can use for testing.

2. **Keep the Hardhat node running**:
   - Leave this terminal window open, as the local node needs to be active for deploying and testing the contract.

## Step 3: Deploying the `DonationContract` Locally

1. **Create a new deployment script**:
   - In the `scripts` folder, create a new file named `deployDonationContract.js`.
   - Add the following code to `deployDonationContract.js`:

     ```javascript
     async function main() {
         // Get the contract factory
         const DonationContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("DonationContract");

         console.log("Deploying DonationContract...");

         // Deploy the contract
         const donationContract = await DonationContract.deploy();
         await donationContract.deployed();

         console.log("DonationContract deployed to:", donationContract.address);
     }

     // Run the deployment script
     main()
         .then(() => process.exit(0))
         .catch((error) => {
             console.error(error);
             process.exit(1);
         });
     ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **`ethers.getContractFactory("DonationContract")`**: Loads the `DonationContract` for deployment.
   - **`.deploy()`**: Deploys the contract to the network specified in the Hardhat configuration.
   - **`.deployed()`**: Waits until the contract is deployed and logs the contract address.

2. **Deploy the contract**:
   - In a new terminal (with the local Hardhat node still running), execute the deployment script:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deployDonationContract.js --network localhost
     ```

3. **Interpreting the Deployment Output**:
   - You should see output similar to:

     ```plaintext
     Deploying DonationContract...
     DonationContract deployed to: 0xYourDeployedContractAddress
     ```

   - The address `0xYourDeployedContractAddress` is where the contract is deployed on the local network. You’ll use this address to interact with the contract in future lessons.

## Wrapping Up

You’ve successfully compiled and deployed the `DonationContract` to a local Hardhat network. Running a local node is essential for testing your smart contracts before deploying them to a live network.

In the next lesson, we’ll explore how to interact with the deployed contract and test its functionality using the Hardhat console.
