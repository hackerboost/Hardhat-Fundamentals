## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll compile our `DonationContract` using Hardhat, run a local Hardhat node for testing, and deploy the contract to our local blockchain. We’ll also cover how to interpret the deployment output.

## Step 1: Compiling the Smart Contract

1. **Open your terminal** in the project root directory.
2. **Run the compile command**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

3. **Check for errors or warnings**:
   - If the compilation is successful, you’ll see a message indicating that the contract has been compiled, and new files will be created in the `artifacts` and `cache` folders.
   - If there are errors, double-check your Solidity code in `DonationContract.sol`.

## Step 2: Running a Local Hardhat Node

1. **Start a local Hardhat node**:
   - Open a new terminal in the project root and run:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat node
     ```

   - This command launches a local Ethereum network on your machine at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`. You’ll see output displaying 20 pre-funded accounts with private keys, which you can use for testing.

2. **Keep the Hardhat node running**:
   - Leave this terminal window open, as the local node needs to be active for deploying and testing the contract.

### Step 3: Deploying the `DonationContract` Locally

1. **Create a new deployment script**:
   - In your project’s root directory, open the `ignition/modules` folder.
   - Inside the folder create a deployment script named `deployDonationContract.js` to handle the contract deployment. 
   _**Note**, you can remove the existing file `Lock.js` that comes with Hardhat_.

### 2. Add the Deployment Code
- Open `deployDonationContract.js` and add the following code:

     ```javascript
     // This setup uses Hardhat Ignition to manage smart contract deployments.
      // Learn more about it at https://hardhat.org/ignition

      const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

      module.exports = buildModule("DonationContractModule", (m) => {

      const donation = m.contract("DonationContract");

      return { donation };
      });
     ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `buildModule`: A function used to create a deployment module. Modules are containers for deployment logic, defining how contracts are deployed, configured, and managed.
   - `module.exports`: Exports the deployment module so it can be used by the Hardhat Ignition system.
   - `buildModule("DonationContractModule", ...)`:
      - The first argument ("`DonationContractModule`") is the name of the module. It identifies the deployment module.
      - The second argument is a callback function `((m) => { ... })` where you define the deployment logic.
      - `m` is a module object provided by Ignition, used to specify deployment actions.
   - `m.contract`: Declares a new contract to be deployed by the module.
   - "`DonationContract`" is the name of the contract (from your project’s source files).
   - `donation`: Stores a reference to the deployed instance of the `DonationContract`.
   - Returning the Deployment Result `return { donation }`. This allows interaction with the deployed contract (e.g., calling its methods or passing it to another deployment)

2. **Deploy the contract**:
   - In a new terminal (with the local Hardhat node still running), execute the deployment script:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deployDonationContract.js --network localhost
     ```

3. **Interpreting the Deployment Output**:
   - You should see output similar to:
![deployed-donation-contract](https://res.cloudinary.com/hackerboost/image/upload/v1733928829/donDeployed_nrr2qz.png)

   - The address `DonationContractModule#DonationContract` is where the contract is deployed on the local network. You’ll use this address to interact with the contract in future lessons.

## Wrapping Up

You’ve successfully compiled and deployed the `DonationContract` to a local Hardhat network. Running a local node is essential for testing your smart contracts before deploying them to a live network.

In the next lesson, we’ll explore how to interact with the deployed contract and test its functionality using the Hardhat console.
