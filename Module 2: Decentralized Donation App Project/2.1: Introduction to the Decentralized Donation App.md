## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of Module 2, where we’ll build a **Decentralized Donation App**. This project will help us dive deeper into the world of decentralized applications (dApps) and learn how to create a real-world, functional blockchain-based app.

## Overview of the Project

The **Decentralized Donation App** is a dApp that allows users to make donations using cryptocurrency, with the goal of creating a transparent, secure, and decentralized way to manage contributions. Unlike traditional donation platforms that rely on centralized entities to manage funds, this dApp will use smart contracts to automate and secure the donation process, providing greater transparency and reducing the risk of mismanagement.

## Project Purpose

The main goals of this project are:
1. **Transparency**: Users can view the total amount of donations collected and see which addresses have contributed.
2. **Security**: Funds are stored securely in a smart contract, and only the contract owner has the authority to withdraw the donations.
3. **Decentralization**: The app eliminates the need for a centralized authority, providing a trustless system for managing and distributing funds.

By the end of this project, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of how to build, test, and deploy a smart contract-powered dApp, as well as how to connect it to a front-end interface.

## Key Features and Functionalities

Here’s what we’ll be building:

1. **Receive Donations**:
   - Users can make donations in ETH (or another supported cryptocurrency) directly to the smart contract.
   - Each donation is logged and stored securely on the blockchain.

2. **Track Donations**:
   - The app will maintain a record of all donations and display the total amount collected.
   - A list of all donors and their respective contributions will be accessible for transparency.

3. **Withdraw Funds**:
   - The contract owner (typically the app creator or organization) will have the ability to withdraw the funds collected.
   - We’ll ensure only the owner has this permission to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.

4. **Set a Donation Goal** (Optional Enhancement):
   - We may implement a feature to set and display a donation goal, providing users with a sense of purpose and progress.

## Tools and Libraries We’ll Use

To build this project, we’ll use a combination of tools and libraries:

### 1. **Hardhat**:
   - A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. We’ll use Hardhat for compiling, deploying, and testing our smart contracts.

### 2. **Solidity**:
   - The programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

### 3. **Ethers.js**:
   - A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. We’ll use `ethers.js` to connect our front end to the smart contract.

### 4. **React**:
   - We’ll create a user-friendly front-end interface using React. This will make it easy for users to interact with the donation app.

### 5. **MetaMask**:
   - A browser extension wallet that allows users to connect to the dApp and make donations.

### 6. **Alchemy/Infura**:
   - We’ll use Alchemy or Infura as our Ethereum node provider to connect to the blockchain when deploying to a test network.

### 7. **Hardhat Toolbox**:
   - A set of plugins and tools that enhance the Hardhat development experience, including testing and debugging capabilities.

### What’s Next?

In the next lesson, we’ll set up our project environment and install the necessary dependencies. By the end of the setup, you’ll be ready to start coding and implementing the core features of the Decentralized Donation App!
