## Introduction
In this lesson, we’ll set up our front-end project using **Next.js**. Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications with features like server-side rendering, making it a great choice for our Decentralized Donation App. We’ll also install the necessary libraries and set up the basic folder structure to get started.

## Step 1: Initializing a New Next.js Project

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. **Create a new Next.js project** using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest decentralized-donation-app
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - Give your project a name (or press Enter to use the default `decentralized-donation-app`).
   - Choose TypeScript support if you prefer TypeScript (optional).

4. **Navigate into your project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd decentralized-donation-app
   ```

5. **Run the development server** to make sure everything is working:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the default Next.js welcome page.

## Step 2: Installing Required Libraries

We’ll need a few libraries to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and style our app.

1. **Install `ethers.js`** for blockchain interactions:

   ```bash
   npm install ethers
   ```

2. **Optional: Install a UI library** like `react-bootstrap` for easy styling:

   ```bash
   npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
   ```

3. **Set up Bootstrap** (if you installed it):
   - Open `pages/_app.js` (or `_app.tsx` if you’re using TypeScript) and add the following line to import Bootstrap’s CSS:

     ```javascript
     import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
     ```

## Step 3: Setting Up the Basic Folder Structure

To keep our project organized, we’ll create folders for components and pages.

1. **Inside your project folder**, create the following structure:

   ```
   /components
     ├── Header.js
     ├── Footer.js
     ├── WalletConnect.js
   /pages
     ├── index.js
     ├── donate.js
     ├── withdraw.js
   ```

### Explanation of the Structure

- **/components**: This folder will contain reusable components like the `Header`, `Footer`, and a `WalletConnect` component to manage MetaMask connections.
- **/pages**: Next.js uses the `/pages` directory to automatically generate routes. We’ll have:
  - **index.js**: The home page where we’ll display donation statistics.
  - **donate.js**: A page where users can make donations.
  - **withdraw.js**: A page for the contract owner to withdraw funds.

## Wrapping Up

You’ve successfully set up a new Next.js project and installed the necessary libraries! Your project is now ready for further development. In the next lesson, we’ll connect our app to MetaMask and set up wallet authentication.
