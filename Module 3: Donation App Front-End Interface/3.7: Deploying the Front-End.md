## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll deploy our Next.js front-end to a hosting platform like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. We’ll also set up environment variables securely and test the deployed app to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

## Step 1: Preparing Your App for Deployment

Before deploying, make sure everything is ready:

1. **Check for Errors**: Run your app locally and ensure there are no errors.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Build Your App**: Run the Next.js build command to check for any build-time errors.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - If there are any errors, fix them before proceeding.

## Step 2: Deploying on Vercel

1. **Sign in to Vercel**:
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.
2. **Import Your Project**:
   - Click on **New Project** and select your GitHub repository containing the Next.js app.
   - Follow the prompts to import your project.
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Vercel automatically detects Next.js and sets the build command to `npm run build` and the output directory to `.next`.
   - Click on **Deploy** to start the deployment process.
4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard and navigate to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Add the required environment variables, such as:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Your deployed contract address.
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY`: Your Alchemy API key (or Infura, depending on your setup).
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet private key (only if needed and ensure it’s securely handled).
5. **Access Your Deployed App**:
   - Once the deployment is complete, you’ll get a URL where your app is live. Visit the URL to test your app.

## Step 3: Deploying on Netlify (Alternative)

1. **Sign in to Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in with your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.
2. **Create a New Site**:
   - Click on **Add New Site** and select **Import an Existing Project**.
   - Choose your GitHub repository and configure the build settings:
     - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
     - **Publish Directory**: `.next`
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Go to your site settings on Netlify, navigate to **Environment Variables**, and add the required variables, similar to the ones for Vercel.
4. **Deploy Your App**:
   - Click on **Deploy Site** and wait for the build and deployment to complete.
   - Once done, you’ll receive a URL for your live app.

## Step 4: Testing the Deployed App

1. **Visit Your Deployed URL**:
   - Open the URL provided by Vercel or Netlify and test the app.
2. **Check Key Features**:
   - **Wallet Connection**: Ensure users can connect their MetaMask wallet.
   - **Donation Functionality**: Test making a donation and ensure the transaction is successful.
   - **Withdraw Functionality**: If you’re the contract owner, test the withdrawal feature.
   - **Loading Spinner and Feedback Messages**: Confirm that feedback messages and the loading spinner work as expected.
3. **Mobile and Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test the app on different devices and browsers to ensure it’s responsive and works seamlessly.
