## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll write a deployment script to deploy your `SimpleStorage` smart contract to the **Arbitrum Sepolia** test network. We’ll then execute the script using Hardhat and verify the deployment on Etherscan.

---

## Step 1: Writing the Deployment Script

### 1. Create a New Script File
- In your project’s root directory, open the `ignition/modules` folder.
- Inside the folder create a deployment script named `deploy.js` to handle the contract deployment. _**Note**, you can remove the existing file `Lock.js` that comes with Hardhat_.

### 2. Add the Deployment Code
- Open `deploy.js` and add the following code:
```javascript
// This setup uses Hardhat Ignition to manage smart contract deployments.
// Learn more about it at https://hardhat.org/ignition

const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");


module.exports = buildModule("SimpleStorageModule", (m) => {

  const storage = m.contract("SimpleStorage");

  return { storage };
});

```

## Step 2: Compiling the Contract

Before deploying, make sure your contract is compiled and ready.

- Run the following command to compile your contract:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

### Common Issues
- If you see any errors during compilation, check your Solidity code for syntax errors or mismatched compiler versions.

## Step 3: Deploying to Arbitrum Sepolia

1. **Run the Deployment Script**
   - Use the following command to deploy your contract to the Sepolia test network:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js
     ```

2. **Expected Output**
   - If the deployment is successful, you’ll see a message like:
     ```bash
     SimpleStorage deployed to: 0xYourContractAddress
     ```
   - Copy and save the contract address, as you’ll need it for verification and interactions.

- You will see something like this on your terminal after deployment:

## Step 4: Verifying the Contract on Etherscan

### 1. Why Verify?
Verification on Arbiscan allows users to view and interact with your contract’s source code.

### 2. Verify Using Hardhat
Run the following command to verify your contract:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arbitrumSepolia 0xYourContractAddress
```

If your contract requires constructor arguments, pass them as follows:
```bash
npx hardhat verify --network arbitrumSepolia 0xYourContractAddress "arg1" "arg2"
```

Replace 0xYourContractAddress with your contract’s deployed address.
Replace "arg1", "arg2" with your contract’s constructor arguments, if any.

### 2. Check Verification on Etherscan
- Visit [Arbiscan](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/) and search for your contract address.

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Deployment Fails**: 
   - Ensure your wallet has enough Sepolia ETH to cover the gas fees.
   - Check your Alchemy RPC URL and wallet private key in the `.env` file.

2. **Verification Fails**: 
   - Double-check the constructor arguments and ensure they match what was used during deployment.
   - Make sure the Etherscan API key in your `.env` file is correct.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed your smart contract to the Sepolia test network and verified it on Etherscan. Your contract is now live and can be interacted with using your wallet or Etherscan's interface.
