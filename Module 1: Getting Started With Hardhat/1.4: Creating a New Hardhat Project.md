## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll set up and write a simple storage contract within the Hardhat project created in the previous lesson. This basic contract will allow you to store and retrieve a number on the blockchain.

## Setting Up Your Contract

1. **Navigate to the `contracts` Folder**:
   - Open the `contracts` folder in your project directory. You should see a sample contract, `Lock.sol`, created during Hardhat’s initialization.
   - To keep things clean, delete `Lock.sol` by right-clicking on it and selecting **Delete**.

2. **Create the `SimpleStorage.sol` Contract File**:
   - In the `contracts` folder, right-click and select **New File**. Name it `SimpleStorage.sol`.
   - Open `SimpleStorage.sol`, then copy and paste the following code:

   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

   contract SimpleStorage {
       // State variable to store a number
       uint256 private storedNumber;

       // Function to store a new number
       function store(uint256 _number) public {
           storedNumber = _number;
       }

       // Function to retrieve the stored number
       function retrieve() public view returns (uint256) {
           return storedNumber;
       }
   }
   ```

## Code Explanation

- **SPDX License Identifier**: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` is a license identifier for the contract, specifying an MIT license.
- **Pragma Directive**: `pragma solidity ^0.8.25;` ensures the code runs on Solidity version 0.8.25 and above.
- **State Variable**: `storedNumber` is a private variable that holds a `uint256` value, representing the stored number.
- **`store` Function**: Takes a `uint256` number as input and stores it in `storedNumber`.
- **`retrieve` Function**: Returns the value of `storedNumber`.

## Wrapping Up

With `SimpleStorage.sol` set up, you’ve created your first smart contract in Hardhat. In the next lesson, we’ll learn how to compile and test this contract to ensure it functions correctly.
