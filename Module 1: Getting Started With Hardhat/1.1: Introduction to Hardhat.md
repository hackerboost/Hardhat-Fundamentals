## Introduction

Welcome to Hardhat 101. In this course, you will develop the skills needed to create, test, and deploy smart contracts using top web3 development tools like _**Chainlink**_, _**Alchemy**_, and _**Hardhat**_.

### What is Hardhat?

Hardhat is a popular and flexible framework for smart contract development, widely known for its developer-friendly features and extensive tooling support. Here’s a brief description of Hardhat:

```Solidity
Hardhat provides an environment to compile and deploy smart contracts, manage dependencies, run tests, and interact with the Ethereum network, all from the command-line or programmatically.
```

For reference, the [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs/) is a comprehensive resource covering everything you need to know about this powerful tool. Make sure to bookmark it; it will be a valuable guide throughout the course.

Hardhat offers several advantages, including:

* **Extensibility** through plugins, which makes it easy to integrate tools like Ethers.js and Waffle.
* **Customizable environments** to run scripts on both local and test networks.
* A **versatile testing environment** for Solidity contracts, enabling detailed debugging.

### Our Favorite Code Editor: Visual Studio Code

Throughout this course, we will use Visual Studio Code to **write**, **test**, **deploy**, and **interact** with our smart contracts. Visual Studio Code is a powerful, lightweight source code editor available on Windows, macOS, and Linux. With its vast ecosystem of extensions, it’s one of the best options for smart contract development.
