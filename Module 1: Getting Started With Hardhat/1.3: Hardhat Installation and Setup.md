## Hardhat Installation and Setup

Now that we have our development environment and project folder ready, let’s dive into installing and configuring Hardhat. These steps will guide you through setting up Hardhat on any operating system to streamline smart contract development.

## Getting Started with Hardhat

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Hardhat requires Node.js and npm to function properly. If you haven’t installed these yet, download Node.js (which includes npm) from [here](https://nodejs.org/). This setup provides the necessary runtime environment for Hardhat.

### Step 2: Install Hardhat

Navigate to the project folder you created in the previous lesson:

```bash
cd hardhat-project
```

With Node.js and npm in place, install Hardhat locally within this directory by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

This command will add Hardhat and its dependencies directly to your project, keeping your global environment clean.

### Step 3: Initialize a Hardhat Project

Now, we’ll use Hardhat’s interactive setup to initialize the project structure.

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

2. **Interactive Setup**: Hardhat will prompt you with several options:
   - Choose **Create a basic sample project**.
   - Confirm when asked to install additional dependencies, as they are essential for the sample project and Hardhat’s functionality.

3. **Project Structure**: After setup, your project folder should now include the following directories and files:
   - `contracts`: Stores Solidity smart contracts. You’ll see a sample contract, `Greeter.sol`.
   - `scripts`: Holds deployment scripts for deploying contracts.
   - `test`: Contains test files for validating contract functionality.
   - `hardhat.config.js`: This configuration file is where you can specify network settings, Solidity compiler versions, and other options.

### Verifying Your Installation

To confirm Hardhat installed correctly, check the version by running:

```bash
npx hardhat --version
```

You should see the version number, indicating that Hardhat is ready for use.

## Tips for Using Hardhat in VS Code

- **Managing Terminals**: You can open multiple terminals in VS Code, which is helpful for running different commands simultaneously. Use the `+` button to open new terminal tabs and the trash icon to close them.
  
- **Using `hardhat.config.js`**: Hardhat’s configuration file, `hardhat.config.js`, is essential for setting up networks, configuring Solidity compilers, and adding plugins. It’s worth taking some time to get familiar with its structure, as we’ll use it to customize our environment as we progress.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Node Path Issues**: If `npx hardhat` doesn’t work, it may be due to a path issue with Node.js. Restarting your terminal usually resolves this. If issues persist, ensure that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.
  
- **Permissions Errors**: Occasionally, installing dependencies might require superuser permissions on Mac or Linux. Use `sudo npm install --save-dev hardhat` if you encounter any permissions errors.

## Wrapping Up

With Hardhat installed and configured, you’re now ready to start developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. If you encounter issues or want to learn more, the [Hardhat Documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs/) is a valuable resource.

In the next lesson, we’ll create a basic smart contract to test our setup and dive into the fundamentals of Solidity development.
