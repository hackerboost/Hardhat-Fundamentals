## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll configure Hardhat to deploy your smart contract to the Ethereum network or a test network like Sepolia. This setup will prepare your project for smooth and secure deployment.

## Why Use Alchemy?

**Alchemy** is a blockchain development platform that provides an API (Application Programming Interface) to connect your dApp or smart contract to Ethereum networks, both test and main networks. It acts as a “node provider,” allowing you to interact with the blockchain without needing to run your own Ethereum node, which can be complex and resource-intensive.

Using Alchemy means you can:
- **Easily connect to Ethereum networks**: Alchemy provides a URL that connects your project to the Ethereum network, making deployment faster and more reliable.
- **Track and debug your transactions**: Alchemy offers powerful developer tools, including dashboards to monitor your transactions and logs, making it easier to debug issues.
  
Other popular providers include **Infura** and **QuickNode**. In this lesson, we’ll use Alchemy, but you can use any similar provider as long as it provides an Ethereum RPC URL.

## Setting Up Network Configuration

1. **Open `hardhat.config.js`**:
   Locate and open the `hardhat.config.js` file in your project’s root directory. This file allows you to define network settings, compiler versions, and plugins.

2. **Add the Network Configuration**:
   Below the existing code, add the following network configuration to specify the network and its parameters:

   ```javascript
   require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

   module.exports = {
     solidity: "0.8.25",
     networks: {
       sepolia: {
         url: "https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY",
         accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"]
       }
     }
   };
   ```

   Replace:
   - `YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` with your Alchemy API key. You can sign up for an API key at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/).
   - `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with the private key of the wallet you want to use for deployment (keep this private and secure).

3. **Installing `dotenv` for Security**:
   To keep your API key and private key secure, we’ll use a `.env` file to store sensitive information.

   1. Install `dotenv`:

      ```bash
      npm install dotenv
      ```

   2. **Create a `.env` File**:
      In your project root, create a new file named `.env` and add your sensitive information like this:

      ```plaintext
      ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
      PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
      ```

   3. **Update `hardhat.config.js`**:
      Modify `hardhat.config.js` to load variables from the `.env` file:

      ```javascript
      require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
      require("dotenv").config();

      const { ALCHEMY_API_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY } = process.env;

      module.exports = {
        solidity: "0.8.25",
        networks: {
          sepolia: {
            url: `https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}`,
            accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY]
          }
        }
      };
      ```

## Important Security Tips

- **Never Share Your Private Key**: Always keep your private key secure and do not share it in public repositories.
- **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`**: Ensure that your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` so it isn’t included in version control:

  ```plaintext
  # .gitignore
  .env
  ```

## Wrapping Up

With this configuration, your Hardhat setup is now ready for deployment using Alchemy. In the next lesson, we’ll create a deployment script and deploy your `SimpleStorage` contract to the Sepolia test network.
