### Getting Started

Prepare yourself because this project is going to be both challenging and extremely rewarding!

In this lesson, we’ll kick off our **Lottery Smart Contract** project, which will feature advanced concepts like:

- **Events**
- **On-chain randomness** (implemented the right way)
- **Chainlink VRF for randomness**
- **Automation with Chainlink Keepers**

Please follow along with Sahabia’s presentation on building a provably fair and automated lottery system. Pay close attention to the code structure and the efficient organization of state variables and functions.

Hopefully, that sparked your excitement. Now, let’s get started!

## Project Setup

1. **Create a New Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a project folder and open it in VS Code:
     ```bash
     mkdir lottery-smart-contract-f23
     cd lottery-smart-contract-f23
     code .
     ```

2. **Initialize a Hardhat Project**:
   - Inside the new VS Code instance, initialize a Hardhat project by running:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to create a basic sample project.
   - **Delete Default Files**: Once initialized, delete all default files (like `Lock.sol`) from the `contracts` folder. We’ll start fresh!

## Planning the Project

Before diving into the code, let’s outline a simple plan for our **Lottery Smart Contract**. In the root directory, create a `README.md` file and structure it as follows:

```markdown
# Provably Random Lottery Contract

## About
This contract creates a decentralized, provably random lottery system.

## Functionality
1. Users can enter the lottery by paying for a ticket (ticket fees will be the prize).
2. The lottery automatically picks a winner after a set time interval using Chainlink VRF for randomness.
3. Chainlink Automation will trigger the winner selection regularly.
```

We’ll use **Chainlink VRF** to generate secure random numbers and **Chainlink Automation** to schedule the lottery draw.

## Initial Smart Contract Setup

1. **Create the Contract File**:
   - Inside the `contracts` folder, create a new file named `Lottery.sol`.
   - Begin with a simple contract template:
     ```solidity
     // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
     pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

     import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

     /**
      * @title A Lottery Contract
      * @notice This contract allows users to enter a lottery and win prizes
      * @dev Utilizes Chainlink VRF for randomness and Chainlink Automation for scheduling
      */
     contract Lottery is VRFConsumerBase {
         // Declare state variables
         address public owner;
         address payable[] public players;
         uint public lotteryId;
         mapping(uint => address payable) public lotteryHistory;

         // Chainlink VRF variables
         bytes32 internal keyHash;
         uint internal fee;
         uint public randomResult;

         // Events
         event RandomnessFulfilled(bytes32 requestId, uint randomness);

         // Constructor
         constructor()
             VRFConsumerBase(
                 0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF coordinator
                 0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709  // LINK token address
             ) {
                 keyHash = 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311;
                 fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK

                 owner = msg.sender;
                 lotteryId = 1;
             }
     }
     ```

2. **Add Functionality Outline**:
   - Next, outline the primary functions for entering the lottery, picking a winner, and handling randomness:
     ```solidity
     function enter() public payable {
         require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether");
         players.push(payable(msg.sender));
     }

     function pickWinner() public onlyOwner {
         getRandomNumber();
     }

     function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
         require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK in contract");
         return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
     }

     function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint randomness) internal override {
         randomResult = randomness;
         emit RandomnessFulfilled(requestId, randomness);
         payWinner();
     }

     function payWinner() internal {
         uint index = randomResult % players.length;
         players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);
         lotteryHistory[lotteryId] = players[index];
         lotteryId++;
         players = new address payable ; // Reset the players array
     }

     modifier onlyOwner() {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
         _;
     }
     ```

## What’s Next?

We’ve set up the basic project structure and outlined the functionality of our Lottery Smart Contract. In the upcoming lessons, we’ll dive deeper into each function, implement Chainlink VRF and Automation, and ensure our contract is secure and efficient.
