## Introduction
Now that we have our project set up, it's time to start writing the core logic for our **Lottery Smart Contract**. We’ll implement key functions that allow users to enter the lottery, manage ticket fees, and select a winner using Chainlink VRF.

## Objectives
In this lesson, you will:
- Write the `enter()` function to handle user entries.
- Implement a mechanism to collect ticket fees and store player addresses.
- Set up functions for Chainlink VRF to request and handle randomness.

### Step 1: Define State Variables and Constructor

1. **Open `Lottery.sol`** in your `contracts` folder.
2. Add state variables to keep track of important information:
   ```solidity
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
   pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

   import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

   /**
    * @title A Lottery Contract
    * @notice This contract allows users to enter a lottery and win prizes
    * @dev Utilizes Chainlink VRF for randomness and Chainlink Automation for scheduling
    */
   contract Lottery is VRFConsumerBase {
       address public owner;
       address payable[] public players;
       uint public lotteryId;
       mapping(uint => address payable) public lotteryHistory;

       bytes32 internal keyHash;
       uint internal fee;
       uint public randomResult;

       // Events
       event RandomnessFulfilled(bytes32 requestId, uint randomness);

       // Constructor
       constructor()
           VRFConsumerBase(
               0xb3dCcb4Cf7a26f6cf6B120Cf5A73875B7BBc655B, // VRF coordinator
               0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709  // LINK token address
           ) {
               keyHash = 0x2ed0feb3e7fd2022120aa84fab1945545a9f2ffc9076fd6156fa96eaff4c1311;
               fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK

               owner = msg.sender;
               lotteryId = 1;
           }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Writing the `enter()` Function

The `enter()` function allows users to join the lottery by sending a minimum amount of Ether. We’ll use Solidity’s `msg.value` to check the amount sent and `payable(msg.sender)` to record the user’s address.

1. **Add the `enter()` function**:
   ```solidity
   function enter() public payable {
       require(msg.value > 0.01 ether, "Minimum entry fee is 0.01 ether");

       // Store the player's address in the players array
       players.push(payable(msg.sender));
   }
   ```

### Explanation
- **require()**: Ensures that the player sends at least 0.01 Ether to enter the lottery. If the condition is not met, the transaction will revert.
- **payable(msg.sender)**: Converts the sender’s address into a payable address so that we can later send Ether to the winner.

### Step 3: Writing the `pickWinner()` Function

The `pickWinner()` function is responsible for selecting a winner. We’ll call the Chainlink VRF function `getRandomNumber()` to request a random number.

1. **Add the `pickWinner()` function**:
   ```solidity
   function pickWinner() public onlyOwner {
       require(players.length > 0, "No players in the lottery");

       // Request a random number from Chainlink VRF
       getRandomNumber();
   }
   ```

### Explanation
- **onlyOwner Modifier**: Ensures that only the contract owner can call `pickWinner()`.
- **require()**: Checks that there are players in the lottery before attempting to pick a winner.

---

### Step 4: Requesting Randomness with Chainlink VRF

1. **Add the `getRandomNumber()` function**:
   ```solidity
   function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
       require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK in contract");

       // Request a random number from Chainlink VRF
       return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
   }
   ```

### Explanation
- **LINK Balance Check**: Ensures that the contract has enough LINK tokens to pay for the randomness request.
- **requestRandomness()**: Calls Chainlink VRF to generate a random number. The `requestId` returned will be used to track the request.

---

### Step 5: Handling Randomness with `fulfillRandomness()`

1. **Add the `fulfillRandomness()` function**:
   ```solidity
   function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint randomness) internal override {
       randomResult = randomness;
       emit RandomnessFulfilled(requestId, randomness);

       // Call the function to pay the winner
       payWinner();
   }
   ```

### Explanation
- **fulfillRandomness()**: This is a callback function that Chainlink VRF calls when the random number is ready. It assigns the random number to `randomResult` and emits an event.
- **payWinner()**: This function will be implemented next to handle the winner payout.

---

### Step 6: Adding the `payWinner()` Function

The `payWinner()` function uses the random number to select a winner and transfers the total Ether balance to the winner.

1. **Add the `payWinner()` function**:
   ```solidity
   function payWinner() internal {
       uint index = randomResult % players.length;
       players[index].transfer(address(this).balance);

       // Update the lottery history
       lotteryHistory[lotteryId] = players[index];
       lotteryId++;

       // Reset the state of the contract
       players = new address payable ; // Reset the players array
   }
   ```

### Explanation
- **Selecting a Winner**: The winner is chosen using `randomResult % players.length`, ensuring that the random number is mapped to a valid player index.
- **Transfer Funds**: The total Ether balance is transferred to the winner’s address.
- **Reset State**: The `players` array is reset for the next round of the lottery.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You’ve successfully written the core functionality of the Lottery Smart Contract. In the next lesson, we’ll dive deeper into integrating Chainlink Automation to schedule the lottery draw and ensure the contract is secure and efficient.
