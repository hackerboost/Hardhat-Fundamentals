## Introduction

Now that you've successfully deployed your Lottery Smart Contract on the **Sepolia** test network, it’s time to interact with it. We’ll guide you through funding the contract with LINK tokens, entering the lottery, picking a winner, and viewing the results.

## Step 1: Fund the Contract with LINK Tokens

Before you can request randomness from Chainlink VRF, you need to ensure your contract has enough LINK tokens to cover the VRF fee.

### How to Get LINK Tokens
1. **Visit the Chainlink Faucet**: Use the [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia) to request LINK tokens for the Sepolia test network.
2. **Fund Your Contract**:
   - **Option 1**: Enter your contract’s address directly into the faucet to receive LINK tokens.
   - **Option 2**: If you receive LINK tokens into your wallet, transfer them to your contract’s address using MetaMask.

### Verifying the Transfer
- Once the tokens are transferred, you can check your contract’s LINK balance on Sepolia Etherscan or using the **getBalance** function in your contract.

## Step 2: Connecting to Your Contract on Etherscan

You can use **Sepolia Etherscan** to interact with your contract. Follow these steps:

1. **Find Your Contract**: Search for your contract address on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
2. **Connect to Web3**:
   - Navigate to the **"Write Contract"** tab.
   - Click on **"Connect to Web3"** and connect your MetaMask wallet. This will enable you to write to the blockchain.

## Step 3: Entering the Lottery

Once your contract is funded with LINK, you can enter the lottery:

### Steps to Enter
1. **Go to the "Write Contract" Tab**: On Etherscan, locate the **enter** function.
2. **Specify the ETH Amount**:
   - Enter an amount greater than 0.01 ETH in the **"Payable Amount (ETH)"** field (this is the minimum required to enter the lottery).
3. **Click "Write"**: This will initiate a transaction from your wallet to add your address to the list of players.
4. **Confirm the Transaction**: Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet. Make sure you have enough Sepolia ETH to cover the gas fees.

## Step 4: Picking a Winner

Once you have enough players, the next step is to pick a winner. Remember, only the contract owner can perform this action.

### Steps to Pick a Winner
1. **Go to the "Write Contract" Tab**: On Etherscan, find the **pickWinner** function.
2. **Click "Write"**: This will send a transaction to trigger Chainlink VRF and generate a random number, selecting a winner.
3. **Confirm the Transaction**: Approve the transaction in your MetaMask wallet.

> **Note**: Ensure your contract has sufficient LINK tokens before picking a winner. The Chainlink VRF process requires LINK to function.

## Step 5: Viewing the Winner and Lottery Details

After the winner has been selected, you can view the details of the lottery round.

### Check the Winner
1. **Go to the "Read Contract" Tab**: Locate the **lotteryHistory** function.
2. **Enter the Lottery ID**: Start with 1 for the first round and increment for subsequent rounds.
3. **View the Winner’s Address**: The function will return the wi nner's address for the specified lottery round.

### Check the Contract Balance
- Use the **getBalance** function in the **"Read Contract"** tab to check the contract's ETH balance.
- **Expected Result**: After a winner is selected and paid, the balance should be 0.

### Check the List of Players
- Use the **getPlayers** function to see the addresses of players who entered the current lottery round.

## Practical Experience Recap

By following these steps, you’ll gain hands-on experience interacting with your Lottery Smart Contract on the Sepolia test network. You’ll understand how to:
- Fund a smart contract with LINK tokens.
- Enter a lottery and manage entries.
- Use Chainlink VRF to pick a random winner securely.
- View and verify results on Etherscan.

This interaction will give you a deeper understanding of integrating off-chain randomness into blockchain projects, an essential skill for building decentralized applications.

In the next lesson, we’ll dive into writing automated scripts for more efficient interactions and handling common issues that may arise during the process. Keep building, and feel free to ask questions if you need assistance!
