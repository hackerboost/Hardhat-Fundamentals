## Introduction

In this lesson, we’ll walk through deploying your Lottery Smart Contract to the **Sepolia** test network using Hardhat. We will also verify the contract on Etherscan for transparency and easy access.

## Step 1: Configuring Hardhat for Deployment

### Hardhat Configuration
1. **Open `hardhat.config.js`** and configure it for the Sepolia network:
   ```javascript
   require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
   require("dotenv").config();

   module.exports = {
       solidity: "0.8.24",
       networks: {
           sepolia: {
               url: process.env.ALCHEMY_RPC_URL, // Your Alchemy RPC URL
               accounts: [`0x${process.env.ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY}`] // Your account private key
           }
       },
       etherscan: {
           apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY // Your Etherscan API key
       }
   };
   ```

### Environment Variables
- **Store sensitive information in a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project:
  ```bash
  ALCHEMY_RPC_URL="https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-alchemy-key"
  ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-private-key"
  ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your-etherscan-api-key"
  ```

> 🛑 **Security Reminder**: Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing your secrets in version control.

## Step 2: Compiling the Smart Contract

1. **Compile your contract** to ensure everything is up-to-date and ready for deployment:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   
```

---

## Step 3: Creating the Deployment Script

1. **Create a deployment script** named `deployLottery.js` in the `ignition/modules` directory. Here’s the deployment script:
   ```javascript
   const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

   module.exports = buildModule("LotteryModule", (m) => {
       // Deploy the Lottery contract
       const lottery = m.contract("Lottery");

       return { lottery };
   });
   ```

### Explanation
- **buildModule**: This is used to define and deploy your contract with Hardhat Ignition.
- **lottery**: Represents the deployed Lottery contract.

## Step 4: Deploying the Contract

1. **Deploy the contract** to the Sepolia test network using the following command:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deployLottery.js --network sepolia --verify
   ```

### What This Command Does:
- **Deploys the Lottery contract**: The `deployLottery.js` script will execute and deploy the contract.
- **Verifies the contract on Etherscan**: If everything is set up correctly, your contract will be automatically verified on Etherscan, making it publicly accessible and transparent.

---

## Step 5: Verifying the Contract on Etherscan

1. **Automatic Verification**: If you have configured the `etherscan` API key correctly in `hardhat.config.js`, the contract will be verified on Etherscan automatically after deployment.
2. **Check Your Contract**: Visit [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and search for your contract address to view the verified contract.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues**:
  - If your contract isn’t verifying, double-check your **Etherscan API key** and ensure the contract is deployed correctly.
  - Make sure your **environment variables** are set properly and that your **account has enough ETH** for deployment fees.

- **Re-deployment**: If something goes wrong, you can adjust your code and re-run the deployment script. Remember to recompile if you make changes to the contract.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You’ve successfully deployed your Lottery Smart Contract to the Sepolia test network and verified it on Etherscan. You are now ready to interact with your contract and test its functionality using a real testnet environment.

In the next lesson, we’ll test the contract functions on the Sepolia network and see how the Chainlink VRF and Automation features work in a live setting.

Keep up the great work, and let’s continue building!
