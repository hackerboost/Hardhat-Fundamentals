## Introduction

In this lesson, weâ€™ll walk through deploying your Lottery Smart Contract to the **Sepolia** test network using Hardhat. We will also verify the contract on Etherscan for transparency and easy access.

## Step 1: Configuring Hardhat for Deployment

### Hardhat Configuration
1. **Open `hardhat.config.js`** and configure it for the Sepolia network:
   ```javascript
   require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
   require("dotenv").config();

   module.exports = {
       solidity: "0.8.24",
       networks: {
           sepolia: {
               url: process.env.ALCHEMY_RPC_URL, // Your Alchemy RPC URL
               accounts: [`0x${process.env.ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY}`] // Your account private key
           }
       },
       etherscan: {
           apiKey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY // Your Etherscan API key
       }
   };
   ```

### Environment Variables
- **Store sensitive information in a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project:
  ```bash
  ALCHEMY_RPC_URL="https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-alchemy-key"
  ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-private-key"
  ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="your-etherscan-api-key"
  ```

> ðŸ›‘ **Security Reminder**: Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing your secrets in version control.

## Step 2: Compiling the Smart Contract

1. **Compile your contract** to ensure everything is up-to-date and ready for deployment:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

---

## Step 3: Creating the Deployment Script

1. **Create a deployment script** named `deployLottery.js` in the `ignition/modules` directory. Hereâ€™s the deployment script:
   ```javascript
   const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

   module.exports = buildModule("LotteryModule", (m) => {
       // Deploy the Lottery contract
       const lottery = m.contract("Lottery");

       return { lottery };
   });
   ```

### Explanation
- **buildModule**: This is used to define and deploy your contract with Hardhat Ignition.
- **lottery**: Represents the deployed Lottery contract.

---

## Step 4: Deploying the Contract

1. **Deploy the contract** to the Sepolia test network using the following command:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deployLottery.js --network sepolia --verify
   ```

### What This Command Does:
- **Deploys the Lottery contract**: The `deployLottery.js` script will execute and deploy the contract.
- **Verifies the contract on Etherscan**: If everything is set up correctly, your contract will be automatically verified on Etherscan, making it publicly accessible and transparent.

---

## Step 5: Verifying the Contract on Etherscan

1. **Automatic Verification**: If you have configured the `etherscan` API key correctly in `hardhat.config.js`, the contract will be verified on Etherscan automatically after deployment.
2. **Check Your Contract**: Visit [Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) and search for your contract address to view the verified contract.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues**:
  - If your contract isnâ€™t verifying, double-check your **Etherscan API key** and ensure the contract is deployed correctly.
  - Make sure your **environment variables** are set properly and that your **account has enough ETH** for deployment fees.

- **Re-deployment**: If something goes wrong, you can adjust your code and re-run the deployment script. Remember to recompile if you make changes to the contract.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully deployed your Lottery Smart Contract to the Sepolia test network and verified it on Etherscan. You are now ready to interact with your contract and test its functionality using a real testnet environment.

In the next lesson, weâ€™ll test the contract functions on the Sepolia network and see how the Chainlink VRF and Automation features work in a live setting.

Keep up the great work, and letâ€™s continue building!
