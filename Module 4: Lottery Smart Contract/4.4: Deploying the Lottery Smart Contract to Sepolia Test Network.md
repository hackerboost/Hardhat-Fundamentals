## Introduction

In this lesson, weâ€™ll walk through deploying your Lottery Smart Contract to the **Arbitrum Sepolia** test network using Hardhat. We will also verify the contract on Arbiscan for transparency and easy access.

---

## Step 1: Configuring Hardhat for Deployment
1. **Install `dotenv`** (for managing environment variables securely):

   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

   Weâ€™ll use `dotenv` to manage sensitive information, like private keys and API keys, in a `.env` file.

### Hardhat Configuration
2. **Open `hardhat.config.js`** and configure it for the Arbitrum Sepolia network:
   ```javascript
   require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
   require("dotenv").config();

   module.exports = {
       solidity: "0.8.28",
       networks: {
           arbitrumSepolia: {
               url: process.env.ALCHEMY_RPC_URL, // Your Alchemy RPC URL for Arbitrum Sepolia
               accounts: [`0x${process.env.ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY}`] // Your account private key
           }
       },
       etherscan: {
           apiKey: process.env.ARBISCAN_API_KEY // Your Arbiscan API key
       }
   };
   ```

### Environment Variables
- **Store sensitive information in a `.env` file** in the root directory of your project:
  ```bash
  ALCHEMY_RPC_URL="https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-alchemy-key"
  ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="your-metamask-private-key"
  ARBISCAN_API_KEY="your-arbiscan-api-key"
  ```

> ðŸ›‘ **Security Reminder**: Ensure your `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing your secrets in version control.

## Step 2: Compiling the Smart Contract

1. **Compile your contract** to ensure everything is up-to-date and ready for deployment:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

---

## Step 3: Creating the Deployment Script

1. **Create a deployment script** named `deployLottery.js` in the `ignition/modules` directory. Hereâ€™s the deployment script:
```javascript
  // This setup uses Hardhat Ignition to manage smart contract deployments.
    // Learn more about it at https://hardhat.org/ignition

    const { buildModule } = require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules");

    module.exports = buildModule("LotteryModule", (m) => {

    const lottery = m.contract("Lottery");

    return { lottery };
});
```

### Explanation

## Step 4: Deploying the Contract

1. **Deploy the contract** to the Arbitrum Sepolia test network using the following command:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deployLottery.js --network arbitrumSepolia
   ```

### What This Command Does:
- **Deploys the Lottery contract**: The `deployLottery.js` script will execute and deploy the contract to Arbitrum Sepolia.

---

## Step 5: Verifying the Contract on Arbiscan

1. **Verify the Contract**: Run the following command to verify the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network arbitrumSepolia <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
   ```

2. **Check Your Contract**: Visit [Arbiscan](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/) and search for your contract address to view the verified contract.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues**:
  - If your contract isnâ€™t verifying, double-check your **Arbiscan API key** and ensure the contract is deployed correctly.
  - Make sure your **environment variables** are set properly and that your **account has enough ETH** for deployment fees.

- **Re-deployment**: If something goes wrong, you can adjust your code and re-run the deployment script. Remember to recompile if you make changes to the contract.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully deployed your Lottery Smart Contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia test network and verified it on Arbiscan. You are now ready to interact with your contract and test its functionality using a real testnet environment.

In the next lesson, weâ€™ll test the contract functions on the Arbitrum Sepolia network and ensure everything works as expected.

Keep up the great work, and letâ€™s continue building!
