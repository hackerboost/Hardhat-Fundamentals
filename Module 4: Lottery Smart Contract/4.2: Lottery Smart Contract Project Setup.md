### Getting Started

Prepare yourself because this project is going to be both challenging and extremely rewarding!

In this lesson, we’ll kick off our **Lottery Smart Contract** project, which will feature advanced concepts like:

- **Events**
- **On-chain randomness** (implemented using blockchain data)
- **Efficient automation**

Please follow along with Sahabia’s presentation on building a deterministic and automated lottery system. Pay close attention to the code structure and the efficient organization of state variables and functions.

Hopefully, that sparked your excitement. Now, let’s get started!

## Project Setup

1. **Create a New Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following commands to create a project folder and open it in VS Code:
     ```bash
     mkdir lottery-smart-contract-hkbt
     cd lottery-smart-contract-f23-hkbt
     code .
     ```

2. **Initialize a Hardhat Project**:
   - Inside the new VS Code instance, initialize a Hardhat project by running:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to create a basic sample project.
   - **Delete Default Files**: Once initialized, delete all default files (like `Lock.sol`) from the `contracts` folder. We’ll start fresh!

## Planning the Project

Before diving into the code, let’s outline a simple plan for our **Lottery Smart Contract**. In the root directory, create a `README.md` file and structure it as follows:

```markdown
# Simple Lottery Contract

## About
This contract creates a decentralized lottery system.

## Functionality
1. Users can enter the lottery by paying for a ticket (ticket fees will be the prize).
2. The lottery picks a winner after the manager triggers the selection process.
3. The randomness for selecting a winner is derived using blockchain data like block hashes and timestamps.
```

We’ll focus on implementing randomness using on-chain data and automating essential functions.

## Initial Smart Contract Setup

1. **Create the Contract File**:
   - Inside the `contracts` folder, create a new file named `Lottery.sol`.
   - Begin with a simple contract template:
   
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

/**
 * @title A Lottery Contract
 * @notice This contract allows users to enter a lottery and win prizes
 */
contract Lottery {
    // Declare state variables
    address public manager;
    address payable[] public currentPlayers; // Stores players for the current round
    address[] public allPlayers; // Stores all players across all rounds
    address payable public winner;
    bool public isComplete;

    // Events
    event WinnerPicked(address indexed winner);

    // Constructor
    constructor() {
        manager = msg.sender;
        isComplete = false;
    }

    // Enter the lottery function

    // Pick a winner function

    // Claim prize function

    // Generate a random number function

    // Get all players function
  
    // Get current players function

}
```

## What’s Next?

We’ve set up the basic project structure and outlined the functionality of our Lottery Smart Contract. In the upcoming lessons, we’ll dive deeper into each function and ensure our contract is secure and efficient.
