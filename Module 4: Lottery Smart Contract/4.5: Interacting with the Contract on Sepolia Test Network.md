## Interacting with the Contract

After deploying your `Lottery` contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia test network, you can interact with it by entering the lottery, picking a winner, and viewing the results. Below are the steps to guide you through these interactions.

### 1. **Fund the Contract with ETH Test Tokens on Arbitrum Sepolia**

Before you can enter a lottery, you need to ensure that your wallet has enough ETH tokens to cover the fee.

- Go to the [GetBlock Faucet](https://getblock.io/faucet/arb-sepolia/) and request some tokens.
- Login or create an account.
- Enter your wallet address into the faucet to receive the ETH tokens directly into your wallet.

### 2. **Connecting to Your Contract on Arbiscan**

Arbiscan provides a user-friendly interface to interact with your deployed contract. Here’s how to connect and interact with your contract:

- **Find Your Contract**: After deploying, you’ll have the contract address. Navigate to [Arbiscan](https://testnet.arbiscan.io/), and search for your contract using this address.
  
- **Connect to Web3**: On your contract’s page on Arbiscan, look for the "Connect to Web3" button, usually found on the "Write Contract" tab. Click it to connect your wallet (like MetaMask).

### 3. **Entering the Lottery**

Now that your wallet is funded and connected, you can start interacting with it:

- **Enter the Lottery**:
  - Go to the "Write Contract" tab on Arbiscan.
  - Find the `enter` function.
  - In the "Payable Amount (ETH)" field, enter an amount greater than or equal to 0.001 ETH (the minimum required to join the lottery).
  - Click on "Write" to send the transaction, which adds your wallet address to the list of players.

  **Note**: Make sure your wallet has enough Arbitrum Sepolia ETH to cover the transaction fee.

### 4. **Picking a Winner**

Once enough players have entered the lottery, you can pick a winner:

- **Pick a Winner**:
  - Still in the "Write Contract" tab, find the `pickWinner` function.
  - Click "Write" to send the transaction. This will trigger the `randomNumber()` to generate a random number and select a winner based on that number.
  
  **Note**: Only the contract owner/manager (the wallet that deployed the contract) can call this function.

### 5. **Viewing the Winner**

After the winner is picked, you can view the details:

- **Check the Winner**:
  - Go to the "Read Contract" tab on Arbiscan.
  - Find the `getWinner` function.
  - Call the function to see the winner’s address for the current round.
  
- **Check the Balance**:
  - Use the `getBalance` function to check the contract’s balance. After the winner is picked, this should be 0, as the entire balance is transferred to the winner.

- **Check the Players**:
  - Use the `getPlayers` function to see the list of addresses that entered the lottery round.
